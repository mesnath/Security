    find ports for each host that is online
    posrt scans
  port interrogation
    find what service (and versions of the services) is running on each open/available port
  nmap scripting engine
    uses more advanced/nuanced applications of nmap
    can be a very noisy
    main benefits:
      network discovery
      sophisticated version detection
      vulnerability detection
      backdoor detection
      vulnerability exploitation
