SPL Injection considerations:
	requres valid SQL Queries
Fully patched systems can be vulnerable due to misconfiguration
inpt field sanitizatiom 
	put info in, cleans up on the back end; if not there essentially just entering raw sql
	unsanitized vs sanitized fields
		unsanitized:
			input fields can be found using a single quote
				will return extraneous information
				' closes a variable, to allow for additional statements/clauses
				may show no errors or genereic error (harder injection)
		sanitized:
			input fields are checked for items that might harm the database (items are removed, escaped or turned into a sigle string)
		validation:
			checks inputs to ensureit meets a criteria (string doesn't contain ')
string vs integer values
is INFORMAITON)SCHEMA database available?
GET request vs POST request HTTP methods
